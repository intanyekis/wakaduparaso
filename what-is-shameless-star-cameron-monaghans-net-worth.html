This makes sense given the fact that he's nowhere near as big of a star as William H. Macy, who makes the most, as well as Emmy Rossum, who led the show for many years. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Variety</a>, Emmy and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">William were making $300,000 - $350,000 per episode of Shameless</a> in the later years. Their pay-disparity is what caused these numbers to go public. So, with that knowledge, we can bet that Cameron would be making somewhere around $100,000 - $150,000 per episode for his portrayal of Ian Gallagher, who is easily one of the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> audiences' favorite characters on Shameless</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How ‘Shameless’ Star Cameron Monaghan Angered Fans On Twitter</a></span></p><p>While this is no chump change, especially given the fact that Shameless has been on for years, Cameron has found ways of diversifying his career as well as taking parts in other massive projects. All of this has led <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth to claim that Cameron Monaghan has a net worth of $5 million</a>.</p><p>Let's find out exactly how Cameron made such dough...</p><h2 id=his-5-million-net-worth-started-with-a-shameless-push-from-his-mother>His $5 Million Net Worth Started With A Shameless Push From His Mother</h2><p>Although Cameron Monaghan was born in Santa Monica, California, he actually grew up in Boca Raton, Florida. It was his single mother who believed Cameron was outgoing enough to enter the entertainment industry. At the age of five, she sent in his photo to a modeling agency, and soon after Cameron booked his first commercial.</p><p>While still in elementary school, Cameron developed his love of acting by participating in a couple of plays. He was also cast in an independent film called The Wishing Stone in 2002, which was his first on-screen credit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon after, Cameron was cast as Winthrop Paroo in the ABC TV adaptation of the classic musical, The Music Man. It was his first taste of stardom, and his first time working with massive stars. In this case, it was&nbsp;Kristin Chenoweth and Matthew Broderick.</p><p>At that point, casting directors all over Hollywood were learning Cameron's name. He just had a certain look about him that intrigued them. Not only that, but Cameron was enigmatic, even back then.</p><p>This energy was what got him cast as Chad, Dewey's classmate, on Fox's beloved comedy Malcolm In The Middle. The role even won him a Young Artist Award. It also won him another recurring role on Nickelodeon's Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide and a ton of guest spots on major shows such as Fringe, Criminal Minds, Numbers, and The Mentalist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, after Malcolm In The Middle, Cameron worked pretty much non-stop. He'd be booked for five or six different parts a year, easily building up a bit of a bak account and helping his single mother with expenses.</p><p>While Malcolm In The Middle opened up the door for Cameron to also appear in various films, such as Adam Sandler's Click,&nbsp;The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause, and playing&nbsp;Bob Andrews in the Three Investigators film series, it was Shameless that really expanded possibilities for Cameron.</p><h2 id=shamelessly-building-his-career-to-a-completely-new-level>Shamelessly Building His Career To A Completely New Level</h2><p>In 2011, Cameron Monaghan was cast in Corey And Lucas For The Win, a series that never quite took off, the teen movie Prom, and, of course, Shameless.</p><p>Cameron has portrayed Ian Gallagher consistently since 2011, despite a brief season break from the show. He will be reprising his character for the upcoming final season due out next year.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How These 15 Shameless Moments Should Have Happened</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Shameless is an ensemble show, Cameron's honest, heartwrenching, seductive, and bad-boy take on a gay bipolar teen really hit home with audiences. His character was particularly important for the LGBTQA+ community. Many critics within that community have commented on how dynamic and nuanced his depiction of the character was.</p><p>So far, Cameron's portal of Ian Gallagher has earned him a spot on 2011's Break-Out TV Actors list and a Critic's Choice Nomination. Not to mention the fact that it absolutely filled his bank account and opened up the door for even more work.</p><p>Between shooting Shameless, Cameron has been involved with other major motion pictures such as Vampire Academy, The Giver, and the independent film Anthem of a Teenage Prophet, where he met his now Ex-girlfriend, Peyton List.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Disney Channel Star Peyton List Made $7 Million</a></span></p><p>The fact that Cameron was becoming a major celebrity lit a fire in his side-gigs as a model and product endorser. But with his specific looks and fit figure, this makes sense.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Cameron was also cast as Jerome and Jeremiah Valeska on Fox's Gotham. Cameron was featured as the sadistic, narcissistic, and totally unhinged Joker-like twins in a total of 20 episodes from 2015 -2019.&nbsp; While there were many villains featured on the Batman prequel show, Cameron's characters served as two of the most dangerous and important characters in the series.</p><p>While serving the audience of one major fandom, Cameron also dipped his toe into another... Star Wars. Cameron was one of the few major actors to be replicated for a character in a Star Wars videogame.</p><p>Although some of the fans rebelled against having a Jedi with red hair, the role in the video game earned Cameron some major bucks.</p><p>And with several more movies in the making, it doesn't seem like Cameron's career is going to slow down any time soon.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside ‘Shameless’ Star Jeremy Allen White’s Relationship With Addison Timlin</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edKhmKadnJrAtHnSrZirZZOWuqa%2BzqdkpqeelrSprc2sZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-shameless-star-cameron-monaghans-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-shameless-star-cameron-monaghans-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-shameless-star-cameron-monaghans-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-shameless-star-cameron-monaghans-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-shameless-star-cameron-monaghans-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-shameless-star-cameron-monaghans-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./carole-radziwill-shares-cryptic-message-after-leaving-rhony.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./carole-radziwill-shares-cryptic-message-after-leaving-rhony.html>Carole Radziwill Shares Cryptic Message After Leaving RHONY</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-alaskan-bush-people-get-married-so-fast.html>This Might Be The Reason The Alaskan Bush People Are Rushing Into Marriage</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-alaskan-bush-people-get-married-so-fast.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
