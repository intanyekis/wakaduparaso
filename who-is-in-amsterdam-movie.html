Fans of movies are accustomed to seeing one or two big stars in a film and maybe a celebrity cameo. The reasoning behind the choice to keep stars in small numbers primarily has to do with money. The more popular a celebrity, the more they charge for screen time. Ensemble casts used to be a rare commodity, but times are certainly changing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amsterdam, which hit theaters on October 7th of this year, has one of the largest celebrity casts of any movie coming out in 2022. The producers and studios were not cutting corners with this film, and they brought in stars from all realms of the entertainment industry. Ranging from Oscar winners to musicians and comedians, the Amsterdam cast is certainly star-studded.

Rock is a famous comedian, most known for his hilarious stand-up specials. Fans are always shocked to learn that Rock actually has a long list of acting credits.

He follows method acting, which is the technique of embodying a character whether or not the cameras are rolling. To follow this technique, Bale has both gained and lost an insane amount of weight for a role.</p><p>In the film Amsterdam, in which Bale plays Burt Berendsen, Bale was told to stop upstaging Taylor Swift during a scene in which they sing together. The director of the film said while shooting, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How about Christian and J.D. [John David Washington] just shut up for this one and let Taylor do it</a>?” Bale knew letting Swift take over was the right decision, saying “we had been drowning out an angel’s voice all day long with our cacophony and our rough, terrible voices.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-as-liz-meekins><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Taylor Swift As Liz Meekins</span></h2><p>Taylor Swift is the celebrity cameo everyone was excited about in Amsterdam.
