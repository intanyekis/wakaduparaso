However, the American comedian has come a long way and has earned his keep. His signature brand of wit and sarcasm has made him one of Hollywood's best paid funny guys. Here's a look at his career and total net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Confusing Facts About David Spade</a></span></p><h2 id=not-so-easy-beginnings>Not So Easy Beginnings</h2><p>While it can be said that David and his two other siblings, Andy and Brian, have been enjoying steady and comfortable lives, its no secret that they had a difficult childhood. Their father, Wayne, left them when David was barely 5 years old. Their mother, Judith, had to take on several jobs to make ends meet. Now, Brian owns a small but relatively successful car business in Arizona and Andy owns designer brand "Kate Spade" together with his wife Kate, who recently passed away.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Sandler And David Spade: Everything We Know About Their Friendship</a></span></p><h2 id=how-it-all-began-with-saturday-night-live>How it All Began with Saturday Night Live</h2><p>Fresh out of college, David first made the rounds of bars and campuses doing stand-up comedy. He frequented comedy hot spots like Greasy Tony's Pizza in Tempe, Arizona. It was in one of these random gigs that he was discovered and offered a small part in the 1987 film Policy Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol. Although he acted alongside Steve Guttenberg and Sharon Stone, the movie was a flop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, this lesser known film led David to better opportunities, like being showcased as one of the six comics for the 13th Annual Young Comedians Show in 1989. During this event, he met fellow comic Dennis Miller, the man who would pave the way for Spade to work as a writer in no less than the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmy Award-winning show, Saturday Night Live.</a> From 1990-1996, David wrote and eventually acted for SNL and it led to some comedy films with fellow funny actor, Chris Farley. The comic duo starred in Tommy Boy&nbsp;and Black Sheep.</p><h2 id=current-net-worth>Current Net Worth</h2><p>Since wrapping up early 2020 with a starring role in<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> a Happy Madison production called The Wrong Missy,</a> Spade is allegedly worth a whopping $60 million these days. His long and productive career in Hollywood has spanned a total of 41 films, including voice over works for animated ones like The Emperor's New Groove and Hotel Transylvania. However, his most iconic role may well be the endearing Joe Dirt in 2001.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from making money in movies, the comedian has also been a part of numerous TV shows such as Just Shoot Me and The Rules of Engagement. Spade earned an Emmy and Golden Globe nomination for his role as the sassy receptionist Dennis Finch in Just Shoot Me.</p><p>If acting in movies and TV is not enough to rake in millions of dollars, the comedian also dabbles in real estate and brand endorsement deals along with voice-over work for computer games such as The Legend of Spyro.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Are All The Famous Women David Spade Has Been Linked To?</a></span></p><h2 id=almost-hosting-the-late-night-show>Almost Hosting The Late Night Show</h2><p>Before getting the hosting stint for Hollywood minute, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spade was actually offered to host The Late Night show</a> before it was eventually given to Conan O'Brien. In an interview with Esquire, Spade admits, "I was asked to have lunch with Bernie Brillstein and Lorne and Brad Grey and they said, 'We talked to NBC and we'd like for you to take over Late Night.' When asked why they picked him even if he was a relatively newcomer in the comedy scene, they said, "Well, you sort of brought a new attitude to Saturday Night Live and a little edge. And you're not like People Magazine. You're going after people and we like that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked if he ever regretted not giving Late Night Show a shot, the actor replied, "No, I mean I like what I've done, and I think hosting is a hard job. I look up to the Fallons and the Lettermans. Like, "Goddamnit it's tough!"Just to go on their as a guest is tough. I was on Fallon the other night, and the next day I went to Ellen. You really have to try to be funny and try to relate and still mention the product. And that's just a guest, let alone host. It's hard. Fallon has got this new thing where he's singing and dancing and all that stuff. It really plays into his hand, and he's really good at it. I would have been more like Letterman. Just do one thing, and it's dry. That used to work and I don't think it does anymore with all the viral stuff and s**t you need to do."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources say NBC offered Spade $2 million to host the Late Night&nbsp;show, but he refused, thinking he lacked the experience for the job. However, even without this lucrative offer, the funny man seems to be doing just fine with his $60 million current net worth.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sorry David Spade, But Nicolas Cage Is The New Tiger King!</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9ZmpK6bmGKxosLInWSsqJGZsrR5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpecisZK2nlJbGcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-how-much-david-spades-net-worth-is-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fheres-how-much-david-spades-net-worth-is-today.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fheres-how-much-david-spades-net-worth-is-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fheres-how-much-david-spades-net-worth-is-today.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-how-much-david-spades-net-worth-is-today.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-how-much-david-spades-net-worth-is-today.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-rich-was-return-of-the-living-dead-cast-clu-gulager-before-he-passed-away-net-worth-update.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-rich-was-return-of-the-living-dead-cast-clu-gulager-before-he-passed-away-net-worth-update.html>How Rich Was Return Of The Living Dead Cast Clu Gulager Before He Passed Away?
