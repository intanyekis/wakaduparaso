<time>28 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>At the height of <a href=#><strong>Friends</strong></a>’ success during its spell on NBC, the sitcom was arguably the best in the genre on television. While only a few actors got the opportunity to be a <a href=#>part of the main cast</a>, many others were also fortunate to appear in guest roles over the years.Sex and the City star Kristin Davis featured in only one episode of the show, but was very impressed by how the main cast carried themselves. She even <a href=#>reserved special praise for Lisa Kudrow</a>, who played Phoebe Buffay in the series. Being a guest star on Friends did not always guarantee a great experience, however.Some like Davis are lucky enough to be able to remember their short stints fondly. The same can be said for Christian Applegate, who was actually <a href=#>shocked by the Primetime Emmy Award she won</a> following her guest appearances in two episodes of the series in 2002 and 2003.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Cast Of Friends Did Some Weird Roles Before Getting Famous</a></span>On the other hand, <a href=#>Lauren Tom was taken aback when she was booed by the live audience</a>, who clearly did not like her character’s romantic involvement with David Schwimmer’s Ross Geller. Young Guns star Dermot Mulroney was another who got his chance to guest star on Friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-character-did-dermot-mulroney-play-in-friends>What Character Did Dermot Mulroney Play In Friends?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dermot-mulroney-2005.jpg><p>Dermot Mulroney is best known for his roles in films such as My Best Friend's Wedding and August: Osage County.
