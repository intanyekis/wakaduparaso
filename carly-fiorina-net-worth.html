She ran an unsuccessful campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, after an unsuccessful challenge against Democrat Barbara Boxer in the 2010 Senate election.</p><p>During her time at HP, Fiorina oversaw the company’s merger with rival computer company Compaq, resulting in the world’s largest personal computer manufacturer at the time. However, her tenure was controversial, and she was later voted as one of the worst American CEOs of all time. Fiorina spent corporate money on acquiring five private jets, including two Gulfstream IVs costing around $30 million each.</p><h2><span id=Carly_Fiorinas_Net_Worth_and_Income>Carly Fiorina’s Net Worth and Income</span></h2><p>Carly Fiorina and her husband had a combined net worth of $59 million in 2015. Her income for 2013 was $13 million. Their combined net worth ranged from $30 million to $120 million in other disclosures. Carly spent $6.5 million on her own presidential campaign.</p><p>During her time at HP, Carly earned $100 million in total compensation. She negotiated a $65 million pay package upon joining the company with a $3 million signing bonus and a $1 million annual base salary that could rise to as much as $5 million with bonuses and stock grants. She received a $21 million severance package when she left HP.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Education>Early Life and Education</span></h2><p>Carly Fiorina was born in Austin, Texas in 1954 to Joseph and Madelon. She was raised in the Episcopalian faith and attended Channing School in London, England before moving on to five different high schools. Fiorina eventually graduated from Charles E. Jordan High School in Durham, North Carolina and went on to earn a BA degree from Stanford University in 1976. She later obtained an MBA from the University of Maryland and an MS degree from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1989.</p><h2><span id=Carly_Fiorinas_Career_Highlights>Carly Fiorina’s Career Highlights</span></h2><p>Carly Fiorina worked at Marcus & Millichap as a receptionist before being promoted to a broker position. She later joined AT&T in 1980 as a management trainee, where she sold telephone services to major federal agencies and eventually oversaw the company’s hardware and systems division and headed its North American operations. In 1995, she led corporate operations for the AT&T spinoff Lucent Technologies and became the president of its consumer products branch in the following year. Fiorina was named group president of Lucent’s global service-provider business in the year after that, where she chaired a huge joint venture between Lucent’s consumer communications and Royal Philips Electronics.</p><h2><span id=Carly_Fiorinas_Tenure_as_CEO_of_HP>Carly Fiorina’s Tenure as CEO of HP</span></h2><p>Carly Fiorina became the first-ever female CEO of Hewlett-Packard Company in 1999 after her success at Lucent. She oversaw the largest technology sector merger in history, with HP acquiring Compaq. However, the merger was met with skepticism, and she faced backlash for changing the company culture and overseeing layoffs.</p><p>During her tenure, HP’s revenue doubled, and cash flow increased by 40%, but net income failed to make gains, and debt rose substantially. The stock price fell by 50%. In 2005, HP’s board proposed a plan to shift Fiorina’s authority to other division heads, which she opposed. The board forced her to resign as CEO and chair of the company. Upon her departure, HP’s stock jumped nearly 7%, adding close to $3 billion to its value.</p><h2><span id=Carly_Fiorinas_Non-profit_and_Board_Memberships>Carly Fiorina’s Non-profit and Board Memberships</span></h2><p>After resigning from HP, Carly Fiorina served on the boards of Revolution Health Group, Cybertrust, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. She also became a member of the MIT Corporation and the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum. In addition, she joined Fox Business Network as a commentator in 2007.</p><p>On the non-profit side, Fiorina is the CEO and chair of Carly Fiorina Enterprises, her own charitable foundation. She also chaired Good360 from 2012 to 2015, an organization that assists companies in donating surplus merchandise to charities. Additionally, she was the fund chair of One Woman Initiative, which aims to empower women in majority-Muslim countries through a partnership between government agencies and the private sector.</p><h2><span id=Carly_Fiorinas_Political_Career>Carly Fiorina’s Political Career</span></h2><p>Carly Fiorina entered politics in 2006 as an advisor on Senator John McCain’s presidential campaign. She ran for office for the first time in the 2010 Senate election, but her campaign was plagued with negative publicity and controversial policy positions, resulting in her loss to Democrat Barbara Boxer.</p><p>In 2015, Fiorina announced her candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination. Her performance in early debates boosted her poll numbers, but they steadily declined, leading to her withdrawal from the race in February 2016. She endorsed Ted Cruz, who chose her as his running mate, but Cruz ended his campaign six days later.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>Carly Fiorina married her first husband, Todd Bartlem, in 1977. They divorced after she began an affair with AT&T executive Frank; she later married Frank in 1985. Fiorina has a stepdaughter named Traci through her husband and had another stepdaughter named Lori Ann who passed away in 2009. The couple currently resides in Mason Neck, Virginia, after previously living in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>Fiorina is a breast cancer survivor, having undergone a double mastectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy in 2009.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCvwKujsmWWnryztc2aZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcarly-fiorina-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcarly-fiorina-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcarly-fiorina-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcarly-fiorina-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcarly-fiorina-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcarly-fiorina-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./laura-dern-baron-davis-kiss-during-lunch-date-pics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./laura-dern-baron-davis-kiss-during-lunch-date-pics.html>Laura Dern, Baron Davis Kiss During Lunch Date: Pics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./a-look-at-cheryl-burkes-rise-in-the-entertainment-industry.html>A Look At Cheryl Burke's Rise In The Entertainment Industry</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./a-look-at-cheryl-burkes-rise-in-the-entertainment-industry.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
