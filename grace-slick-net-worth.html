She played a significant role in the 1960s psychedelic rock scene, producing hits such as “White Rabbit” and “Somebody to Love.” Slick was a member of Jefferson Airplane and subsequently joined Jefferson Starship and Starship, off-shoot groups created by some of the original members.</p><p>Slick still owns the majority of control and royalties generated by “White Rabbit,” a song she wrote and produced. The song remains popular on streaming services, in commercials, and films decades after its release.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Education>Early Life and Education</span></h2><p>Grace Slick was born in Highland Park, Illinois, in 1939. Her father worked as an investment banker, which led to the family moving frequently during her childhood. She lived in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and the Chicago metropolitan area before settling in Palo Alto, California. Slick attended Palo Alto Senior High School before transferring to the private, all-girls Castilleja School. After graduating high school, she attended Finch College in New York City for a brief time before moving to Coral Gables, Florida to attend the University of Miami for one year.</p><h2><span id=Modeling_and_Music>Modeling and Music</span></h2><p>While living in California, Slick worked as a model for I. Magnin & Company department stores. She also began to compose music during this time. In 1961, she married aspiring filmmaker Gerald Slick and the couple moved to San Francisco.</p><h2><span id=Grace_Slicks_Music_Career>Grace Slick’s Music Career</span></h2><p>Grace Slick was inspired to pursue a music career after reading about Jefferson Airplane in 1965. She formed her own band, The Great Society, and wrote the psychedelic hit “White Rabbit” in just half an hour. The band also produced the popular song “Somebody to Love.”</p><p>After The Great Society, Slick was asked to join Jefferson Airplane in 1996, following the departure of one of their singers. She began recording with the group later that year.</p><h2><span id=Jefferson_Airplanes_Surrealistic_Pillow>Jefferson Airplane’s “Surrealistic Pillow”</span></h2><p>Jefferson Airplane’s second studio album “Surrealistic Pillow” was released in February of 1967. The album included hits Slick had written with her previous band, and both “Somebody to Love” and “White Rabbit” became chart-topping singles. The former peaked at no. 5 and the latter peaked at no. 8. on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>The album remains heralded as one of the most influential of the psychedelic rock era. At the time, their blend of folk with psychedelic funk was praised by critics as being novel and unique. As of 2020 it ranks no. 471 on Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.</p><h2><span id=Jefferson_Starship_and_Solo_Work>Jefferson Starship and Solo Work</span></h2><p>In 1970, Jack Casady and Jorma Kaukonen left Jefferson Airplane, and the remaining members formed Jefferson Starship. They released their debut album, “Dragon Fly,” in 1974, which was certified gold and peaked at no. 11 on the Billboard 200. Their second album, “Red Octopus,” was released in 1975 and reached no. 1 on the Billboard 200. The group continued to release successful albums, including “Spitfire” in 1976 and “Earth” in 1978. Slick left the group for three years but returned for “Modern Times” in 1981 and the subsequent two albums.</p><p>After the release of “Nuclear Furniture” in 1984, the group disbanded, but Slick and a few members continued under the name Starship. Slick left Starship in 1988 to join Jefferson Airplane in a reunion tour the following year. In addition to her work with Jefferson Airplane and its affiliates, Slick released several solo albums, including “Manhole” in 1974, “Dreams” in 1980, and “Welcome to the Wrecking Ball!” in 1981.</p><h2><span id=Grace_Slicks_Personal_Life_and_Career>Grace Slick’s Personal Life and Career</span></h2><p>After finishing the reunion tour with Jefferson Airplane, Grace Slick retired from the music business due to feeling too old to live the lifestyle. She was first married to cinematographer and band member Jerry Slick from 1967 to 1971. Between her first and second marriage, she had a daughter with her Jefferson Airplane bandmate Paul Kantner. She later married lighting director Skip Johnson in 1987, and the two divorced in 1994. Slick has been open about her struggles with substance abuse and alcoholism, which caused issues on tour with Jefferson Starship. In 1980, Slick authorized a biography about her titled “Grace Slick: The Biography.”</p><h2><span id=Grace_Slick_Loses_Home_in_Fire_Wins_Settlement>Grace Slick Loses Home in Fire, Wins Settlement</span></h2><p>Grace Slick, longtime resident of Mill Valley, lost her home in a fire in September 1993. The fire was caused by county workers conducting a controlled burn that got out of control. Slick sued the county and won a large settlement, allowing her to purchase a $960,000 2-acre property in Malibu in 1996. The home is now estimated to be worth between $4-5 million.</p><p>Slick sold her Mill Valley property for $650,000 in 1995.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCz0ZqanmWjobakt4ynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgrace-slick-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgrace-slick-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgrace-slick-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgrace-slick-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgrace-slick-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgrace-slick-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./inderpaul-sandhu.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./inderpaul-sandhu.html>InderPaul Sandhu</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bret-iwan-dating-girlrfiend-net-worth-mickey-mouse-wiki-bio-age-height.html>Bret Iwan Dating, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Mickey Mouse, Wiki-Bio, Age, Height</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bret-iwan-dating-girlrfiend-net-worth-mickey-mouse-wiki-bio-age-height.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
