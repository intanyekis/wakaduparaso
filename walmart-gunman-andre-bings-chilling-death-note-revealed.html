Things just fell into place, like the Devil was leading me,” <a href=#>Andre Bing</a> wrote before killing six of his coworkers in the break room at the beginning of their night shift on Tuesday.</p><p style=color:#252525><a href=#>Dahmer was a well-known loner who killed 17 young men</a>. He tried to turn some of them into sex zombies, and he ate body parts from others. In 1994, he was killed in prison.</p><p style=color:#252525>Chesapeake, Virginia, police released Bing’s redacted screed, which was found during a forensic analysis of the suspect’s phone after he killed people and then killed himself.</p><p style=color:#252525>Officials also said that loner Bing bought the murder weapon, a 9mm handgun, legally the morning of the rampage, even though he had never been in trouble with the law before.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Andre-Bing-77-2.jpg alt="Bing, 31, apologized to God for what he was about to do and whined about being mistreated by his colleagues. " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p style=color:#252525>In his scary manifesto, Bing, who was 31 at the time, said he was sorry for what he was about to do and blamed others for making fun of him.</p><p style=color:#252525>“My real goal was never to kill anyone.” Believe it or not, if you got to know me, I was one of the kindest people in the world.</p><p style=color:#252525>Bing wrote that his only wish would have been to start over from scratch and that his parents would have paid more attention to his lack of social skills.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Andre-Bing-77-2.jpg><p style=color:#252525>He wrote that a female coworker had a “demonic aura,” but he also blamed her for never taking the time to get to know him.</p><p style=color:#252525>In one passage, the 31-year-old wrote that he regretted not being able to find a wife who shared his obsession with thoughts. He said, “I just wanted a wife who was as tied to thought as I was, but I didn’t deserve a wife.”</p><p style=color:#252525>Bing said that he wanted to help a coworker who seemed to have cancer. He said, “I have a special place in my heart for her because my mother died of cancer.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Dahmer-73-1.jpg><p style=color:#252525>He ended the letter by saying, “My God, please forgive me for what I’m about to do…</p><p style=color:#252525>In the meantime, a 2017 Facebook post has been found that seems to show that At Bing had a history of mental illness.</p><p style=color:#252525>In September 2017, the gunman’s brother, Pervis Bing, wrote in a status update, “My brother was fighting paranoid schizophrenia around this time, and life was kind of dark…</p><p style=color:#252525>The brother’s comment seems to agree with what Bing wrote about his mental state in his “death note”: “By making them think I was normal, I let down my management team and everyone who has ever loved me.”</p><p style=color:#252525>Also on Friday, police in Chesapeake finally named the 16-year-old boy who was killed in Tuesday’s rampage. His name was Fernando Chavez-Barron, and he was from Chesapeake.</p><p style=color:#252525>Brian Pendleton, who was 38, Kellie Pyle, who was 52, Lorenzo Gamble, who was 43, Randy Belvins, who was 70, and Tyneka Johnson, who was 22, were also named as victims before.</p><p style=color:#252525>Police said that Bing, who worked as a night shift manager, went into the break room at the Chesapeake Walmart around 10:15 p.m. on Tuesday and started shooting at workers who were getting ready to go back to work.</p><p style=color:#252525>One coworker who lived through the shooting said that Bing seemed to be shooting at specific people and that he shot at some people after they had already been hit and looked dead.</p><p style=color:#252525>Jessica Wilczewski said, “The way he was acting, he was going hunting.” “By the way he looked at people’s faces and did what he did, he picked them out.”</p><p style=color:#252525>Some people who worked with Bing said that he had a reputation for being an aggressive or even hostile boss. He once said that he had “anger issues.” But he could also make people laugh, and it looked like he was dealing with the usual stresses of work that many people face.</p><p><strong>Related Stories Recommended By Writer:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Walmart Shooting Update: Six ‘targeted’ Including Teenager By Suspect Andre Bing In Chesapeake Rampage</a></li><li><a href=#>Shooting At US Walmart Store 7 people dead, including gunman</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfqb%2BmusOipaBnp5a5rq3RrWSgrZ6irq95wKebq51dl7avs9JmmqGhnKG2r7OMnZyarJhiu7DAxGapnq6VlrmmsI5taGlvaGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwalmart-gunman-andre-bings-chilling-death-note-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwalmart-gunman-andre-bings-chilling-death-note-revealed.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwalmart-gunman-andre-bings-chilling-death-note-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwalmart-gunman-andre-bings-chilling-death-note-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwalmart-gunman-andre-bings-chilling-death-note-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwalmart-gunman-andre-bings-chilling-death-note-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hard-summer-lineup-218397.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hard-summer-lineup-218397.html>HARD Summer Lineup Boasts A$AP To Axwell</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./10-contestants-from-the-voice-who-found-success-after-the-show.html>10 Contestants From 'The Voice' Who Found Success After The Show</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./10-contestants-from-the-voice-who-found-success-after-the-show.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
