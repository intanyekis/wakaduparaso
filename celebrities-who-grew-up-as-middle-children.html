They're the children that don't receive as much attention, are overlooked, and tossed to the side. It's not easy being in the middle and growing up between the eldest kid and youngest sibling. And yes, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">middle child syndrome</a> is actually a thing. However, there are many celebrities that made a name for themselves despite the typical stereotypes associated with being a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">middle child</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Top 10 Most Intense Celebrity Sibling Rivalries</a></span></p><p>So, which famous middle children don't need a holiday dedicated to them to get attention every day of the year?</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Kim Kardashian</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who had to vie for attention as a child? The business mogul and reality television star that certainly doesn't have to nowadays, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian</a>.</p><p>For any middle child that is searching for self-actualization, A-lister Kim K is definitely the one to look to for inspiration. Of course, we naturally think of the Kardashian family as a family of five women, but Kim grew up stuck between Kourtney and&nbsp;Khlo√©. Just look at how far this middle child has come - just a decade ago, she was surrounded by the likes of Ray J and Reggie Bush. And now, she's her own person.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Miley Cyrus</span></h2><p>Enthusiasts of the Hollywood singer and actress, Miley Cyrus, know that she was born into a huge family. Besides her famous dad, Billy Ray Cyrus, the lady we once knew as Hannah Montana also made a name for herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer, who has garnered a lot of attention over the span of her career, is smack in the middle of her big family. With two brothers and two sisters, Miley looks up to Trace and Brandi and guides the two youngest, Braison and Noah.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jennifer Lopez</span></h2><p>She's still "Jenny from the Block," but what many don't know about the Hustler actress is that she shares her infamous last name with two siblings.</p><p>Lopez, an independent woman whose versatility has helped her bounce back and forth between singing, acting, and performing is a middle child. Yes, there are two other Lopez sisters that share her incredible genes. Raised in the Bronx, J.Lo was stuck like glue to both her sisters, the older Leslie and younger Lynda.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">W Magazine</a>, she said,&nbsp;"I'm the middle sister. All three of us girls shared a room."</p><h2 id=britney-spears><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Britney Spears</span></h2><p>What hasn't poor Britney Spears been through? The "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" singer may have conformed to the middle child stereotypes.</p><p>Her life has been a whirlwind, but growing up in the Spears household, the singer known for her pop hits, was in the middle. Are you surprised? We all know her younger sister, former Zoey 101 actress, Jamie Lynn, but there's another sibling in the trio. Spears' brother Bryan Spears, who's the eldest, also works in the industry as a television and film producer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears Fans React To Singer Wanting To End Conservatorship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sarah-jessica-parker><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sarah Jessica Parker</span></h2><p>We all instantly became obsessed with SJP as Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City!

According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop Sugar</a>, she comes from a family of eight, but that includes her half-siblings. When it comes to her actual blood, SJP is right in between Timothy Britten Parker and Pippin Parker.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What We Know About The 'Sex And The City' Revival</a></span></p><h2 id=anne-hathaway><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Anne Hathaway</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We know her from The Devil Wears Prada, The Princess Diaries, and countless other films, but this Oscar-winner is the middle child in her family.</p><p>With a fiery personality and a gracious heart, Hathaway was raised alongside two brothers, Michael and Thomas.

But, what if we added another into the mix? Well, it turns out there's another brother who's also a successful actor, the Westworld star, Luke Hemsworth. Although Chris is older than the talented Liam, he's younger than Luke.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chris was certainly not overlooked as a child!</p><h2 id=katy-perry><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Katy Perry</span></h2><p>Who doesn't recall when the pop superstar broke out of her shell with her mega-hit, "I Kissed A Girl?"</p><p>Katy Perry is one celebrity who certainly went against all "middle child" odds and turned her status into major stardom.
