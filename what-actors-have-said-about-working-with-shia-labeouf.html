A video was later released showing Wilde on the phone with the actor, saying she was “not ready to give up on this yet.” She also alludes to tension between LaBeouf and the film's lead Florence Pugh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This isn't the 36-year-old's first time involved in drama. The Transformers actor is almost as known for his off-set antics as he is for his roles. He has been in trouble with the law, fired from sets and had complaints about his behavior from co-stars.</p><p>Shia LaBeouf first hit our screens in 2000 when he appeared in the Disney show Even Stevens. He then went on to global frame in huge franchises like Transformers, action clicks like Eagle Eye and prestigious films like Pieces of a Woman. In recent years he has become more known for his eccentric behavior and run-ins with the law.</p><p>Here are some of the things Shia LaBeouf's co-stars have said about him over his many years in the industry.</p><h2 id=fka-twigs-filed-lawsuit-against-shia-labeouf><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>FKA Twigs Filed Lawsuit Against Shia LaBeouf</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a lawsuit filed in 2020, Los Angeles Superior Court, <a href=#>singer and actress FKA Twigs listed five "causes of action" –</a> battery, sexual battery, assault, emotional distress and gross negligence – against LaBeouf and sought an unspecified monetary damage from him after their nearly year-long relationship.</p><p>Twigs' lawsuit asserted LaBeouf knowingly gave her a sexually transmitted disease and also accused him of “relentless abuse.” The pair met in 2018 on the set of Honey Boy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Evan Rachel Wood Stands By FKA Twigs Amid Shia LaBeouf Abuse Allegations">Evan Rachel Wood Stands By FKA Twigs Amid Shia LaBeouf Abuse Allegations</a></span></p><p>She told Louis Theroux on his podcast about a frightening incident in February 2019, where LaBeouf was driving recklessly without a seat belt and "threatening to crash the car unless I said I loved him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Twigs says her life became a “living nightmare” after she entered a relationship with LaBeouf, according to the lawsuit. She explained that LaBeouf groomed her, “gradually gaining her trust but with the intent of abusing her.” Later, he allegedly engaged in a “continuous stream” of verbal and mental abuse, “belittling” and “berating” her, which soon turned physical and “increasingly violent.”</p><p>He "ended up basically strangling me in public at a gas station and nobody did anything," she shockingly revealed. "That was a really low moment for me because I felt like I would never be believed."</p><p>She also claimed LaBeouf kept a loaded gun by the bed and that she was not allowed to wear clothes in bed. She also said he would deprive her of sleep. The case will head to court in April 2023 and any monetary gains from the case will be donated to charity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>“I hurt that woman. And in the process of doing that, I hurt many other people</a>, and many other people before that woman," Shia said. "I was a pleasure-seeking, selfish, self-centered, dishonest, inconsiderate, fearful human being.” He also claims the British singer saved his life and encouraged him to turn his life around. This led to him converting to Catholicism, 627 days of sobriety and becoming a father.</p><h2 id=did-shia-labeouf-and-even-stevens-39-co-star-christy-carlson-romano-get-along><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Did Shia LaBeouf And Even Stevens' Co-Star, Christy Carlson Romano Get Along?</span></h2><p><a href=#>Even Stevens star Shia LaBeouf didn't get long on set with Christy Carlson Romano.</a> The pair played siblings Ren and Louis in the Disney series, which ran from 2000 to 2003 across three seasons.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Christy Carlson Reveals The Grudge She's Been Holding Against Shia LaBeouf For Years">Christy Carlson Reveals The Grudge She's Been Holding Against Shia LaBeouf For Years</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“There’s also some kind of ‘set politics,” she said of her time starring on the show in a video posted to her YouTube channel. “Here’s some tea for you guys.

And you just have to let them do their thing and hope it doesn’t affect you too deeply.”</p><p>LaBeouf had previously spoken about the toll the shoot took on his costar. Back in 2012, LaBeouf spoke to the New York Post’s Page Six about the controversy.</p><p>"She was calling her attorney, like, "Get me the **** of here." … Mia was ready to walk away from the movie. I was really pretty aggressive about it, and not in any kind of weird, strange way, but I don’t think she had ever experienced anything like that."</p><h2 id=shia-labeouf-had-on-set-romance-with-megan-fox><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Shia LaBeouf Had On-Set Romance With Megan Fox</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Megan Fox revealed in 2018 that she had an on-set romance with Shia LaBeouf.
