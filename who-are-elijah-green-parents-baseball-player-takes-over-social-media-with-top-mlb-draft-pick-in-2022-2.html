<time>23 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The Washington Nationals are counting on Elijah Green to be their next superstar after choosing the IMG Academy outfielder with the fifth overall choice in the 2022 MLB draft.</p><p>Green hails from an athletic family, joining Druw Jones (son of Andruw Jones), Justin Crawford (son of Carl Crawford), and Jackson Holliday (son of Matt Holliday) in a draft class full of legacy players.</p><p>Eric Green, his father, was a tight end in the NFL for ten years and twice reached the Pro Bowl (1993, 1994).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mlb-who-are-elijah-green-parents></span>MLB: Who Are Elijah Green Parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elijah Green is born to his parents, Eric and Leslie Green with two brothers and four sisters. He is making headlines as the son of a former NFL star who is drafted 5th overall by the Washington Nationals in the 2022 Major League Baseball draft.</p><p>His son&nbsp;was prospering as an AAU quarterback, leading his team to a pair of 8U crowns before going on to win titles at the 10U and 12U levels.</p><p>His father hoped that his football skills would propel him to a high-profile college career and, maybe, the pros. Elijah’s 12-year-old Little League team traveled to Cooperstown for the annual summer tournament, where he batted sixth or seventh.</p><p>“At the moment, he saw football a lot better than baseball,” Eric added. “He was well-versed in the game.”</p><p>However, Elijah enjoyed baseball much more. Elijah opted to give up football and focus only on baseball when he was 13, laying the way for what he believed would be his own professional sports career.</p><p>“It was just a passion for baseball,” Elijah explained. “Because football took away baseball for half the year, quitting football merely demonstrated my genuine love for baseball.”</p><p>It was a difficult period for him since his father played in the NFL, but he was always there for him, he says. Eric, who wanted the best for his kid, described the decision as “very difficult.”</p><p>Although he had high hopes for Elijah’s football career, he provided him with some pointers on how to succeed on the field.</p><p>“I told him, ‘How hard you work, that’s how much attention you’re going to get when the time comes,” Eric explained.</p><p>He was moved by that. When he first started playing full-time baseball, he wasn’t the best player on his team; he was probably in the bottom five.</p><p>But he enjoyed and eventually become one of the best people in his class.</p><p>Elijah is now considered one of the best prospects in this year’s MLB Draft, a five-tool talent with the most upside of anybody in the 2022 class.</p><p>Elijah talks about the inspiration and the enlightenment from his father. “He constantly told me, ‘You never know who’s watching, so play hard, keep going, and never quit,'” Elijah explained.</p><p>“From an early age, dad taught me to always do the right thing, not the wrong thing.” “I feel that doing the right thing has always shown, and people simply want to follow that throughout life.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-elijah-green-dad-eric-and-mom-leslie-green></span>Meet Elijah Green Dad Eric And Mom Leslie Green<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elijah Green’s dad Eric Green was a two-time Pro Bowler and a 1990 All-Pro tight end with the Steelers, Dolphins, Ravens, and Jets during his 10-year NFL career.</p><p>The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Green twenty-first overall in the NFL Draft. He first went on strike for 54 days, missing training camp, preseason, and the first game of the 1990 NFL season.</p><p>Green initially threatened to sit out the full season, which would have qualified him for the 1991 NFL Draft.</p><p>His arrival at Steelers caused a revolution in the game. Until Green returned to the lineup, the Steeler’s offense failed to score a touchdown.</p><p>He caught five of Bubby Brister’s seven touchdown throws when he returned. As a result of Green’s comeback, defensive line coach Joe Greene stated, “Without Eric Green, we would not have scored a touchdown last year.”</p><p>Green’s flexibility was demonstrated in his first season when he was asked to play wide receiver, slotback, wingback, H-back, and even running back.</p><p>Green signed a six-year, $12 million contract with the Miami Dolphins on March 11, 1995, becoming the highest-paid tight end in NFL history at the time of his signing.</p><p>Unfortunately, Green was released by the Miami Dolphins on July 9, 1996, by then-coach Jimmy Johnson due to his weight issues and work ethic.</p><p>In late September 1996, he worked out with the Ravens before finishing his NFL career with the New York Jets.</p><p>Once resigned from the NFL, he moved to Florida with his wife Leslie Green, and two children. He is the father of three sons and four daughters.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=elijah-green-ethnicity-nationality-and-origin></span>Elijah Green Ethnicity Nationality And Origin<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elijah Green is an American baseball player whose origin lies in Savannah Georgia as his father was born there.</p><p>More information about the player will be released soon. At the moment he does not have a Wikipedia page dedicated to him. But soon enough he will make that happen.</p><p>MLB.com reports that:</p><p>“Green is an elite-level runner who can steal bases and cover a lot of territory in the outfield, where he should be able to play center field for a long time with a solid arm.’</p><p>“His whole toolbox doesn’t come along very frequently, so even if there are still worries about his hit tool, someone in the top of the first round will likely call his name.”</p><p>Finding a real centerfielder who can hit for power is a difficult task. Green has the potential to become a future All-Star if he can improve his hitting tool and tap into his power potential.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqivsRmnKWhmpa1brPRnpynZaCWv6a606xkm5mjmq%2BiuMtmp6WZqZq%2FbsDApJysZZ%2BrsrN50qiaopmcYrqmsMiaZLChpJ16tbvPZqSlml2Zv6Ky02anopubYraveZFpaWtlYmQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-elijah-green-parents-baseball-player-takes-over-social-media-with-top-mlb-draft-pick-in-2022-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-are-elijah-green-parents-baseball-player-takes-over-social-media-with-top-mlb-draft-pick-in-2022-2.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-elijah-green-parents-baseball-player-takes-over-social-media-with-top-mlb-draft-pick-in-2022-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-are-elijah-green-parents-baseball-player-takes-over-social-media-with-top-mlb-draft-pick-in-2022-2.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-elijah-green-parents-baseball-player-takes-over-social-media-with-top-mlb-draft-pick-in-2022-2.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-elijah-green-parents-baseball-player-takes-over-social-media-with-top-mlb-draft-pick-in-2022-2.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hottest-celebrity-pics-this-week-emily-ratajkowski-nov-18-24.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hottest-celebrity-pics-this-week-emily-ratajkowski-nov-18-24.html>Hottest Celebrity Pics This Week Of Nov. 18-24: Emily Ratajkowski &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-harry-hill-arm-junior-bake-off-presenter-shares-about-accident-that-led-to-shoulder-injury.html>What Happened To Harry Hill Arm?
