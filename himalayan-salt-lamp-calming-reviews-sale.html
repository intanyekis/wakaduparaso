They bring us peace, relaxation, good vibes and, of course, a statement piece for our bedrooms and living rooms! Think the glow of a candle without the smoke or scent, or the soothing properties of a cup of hot tea without the part where we burn our tongues. That’s a salt lamp at its core, but it’s also so much more.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>Himalayan Glow 1002 Pink Crystal Salt Lamp</a> has thousands upon thousands of reviews from happy shoppers everywhere. It’s made from hand-carved Himalayan rock salt, which is both beautiful and unique. The salt works harmoniously with the bulb inside to give off an amber glow unlike a traditional table lamp. It’s warm, calming and refreshing, and we want one for every room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Salt-Lamp-Product.jpg><p><strong>See it: Check out the <a href=# rel=noopener>Himalayan Glow 1002 Pink Crystal Salt Lamp</a>&nbsp;marked down 50% off on Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, January 26, 2019, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>Himalayan Glow describes the lamp’s visible aura as “a primordial glow, one part sunset, one part molten lava.” The white light from our nightstand lamp sure doesn’t look like that! How cool is it to be able to have a captivating piece like this in our own homes? It’s certainly a conversation starter, so prepare to gush all about it when inviting friends and family over.</p><p>Holding the crystal salt lamp up is a 100% natural neem wooden base. It’s anti-bacterial, which pairs nicely with the purifying qualities of the lamp. It’s also durable and termite-resistant, so no unwanted critters will be leaving any ugly marks. Considering the lamp is literally made out of salt, it’s nice to know that no one will be taking any bites out of it while we’re relaxing with our eyes closed.</p><p>Many shoppers like to use <a href=# rel=noopener>this lamp</a> in the bedroom as a sleep aid. The lamp has a dimmer, so we can turn it down nice and low to act as a nightlight. This isn’t only helpful for when we need to get up for a glass of water in the early hours of the morning, but also for easing us back to sleep with its soothing glow.</p><p>While it’s great to have in the bedroom, the six-foot power cord makes it easy to place just about anywhere. We can put it on our desks to keep us calm during stressful days, or set it on our coffee table for some extra relaxation while sitting back with a book or streaming a movie. We can also set it next to us while flawlessly flowing through a yoga routine, or flopping around on our mats while our favorite YouTube instructor encourages us to continue on. It’s heavy enough that if our plank pose turns into a plop pose, we won’t accidentally knock it over.</p><p>That reminds Us of how great it would be in a professional space. Yoga studios, of course, would benefit from the energies of this salt lamp, as well as its calming lighting. But it could also create a more comfortable atmosphere in typically tense locations, such as doctors’ offices or perhaps take-out food joints where there are a million different toppings available and the serving employee is yelling at us inaudibly from behind the sneeze-guard to ask what we want on our burrito and we’re panicking. It’s stressful for Us, okay?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Salt-Lamp-Model.jpg><p><a href=# rel=noopener>This salt lamp</a> also makes a great <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> that just about anyone would appreciate. Friends, significant others and family members will all be rightfully impressed by the thoughtfulness. Because it works in so many spaces, it can work for anyone we gift it to. We sure wouldn’t mind the gift of tranquility, especially when it’s as easy as a turn of a switch.</p><p>Another reassuring quality of this lamp is its safety and quality. The brand says it’s ETL certified, which means it meets North American safety standards. A calming lamp doesn’t stand a chance at calming us down without guaranteed safety, so we can check that off the list!</p><p>Shoppers can’t get enough of this unique piece in their homes. One shopper called it “the most soothing light” they’d ever owned, even after initially viewing it as “trendy nonsense.” It changes minds quickly! Another shopper was thrilled to report that having this lamp in their young son’s bedroom has successfully treated his allergies. Now that’s a selling point. The purification qualities are legit!</p><p>We want in on this trend now. And by “trend,” we mean every good thing that comes with owning this Himalayan salt lamp, and as we just demonstrated, that’s a lot of good things.</p><p><strong>See it: Check out the <a href=# rel=noopener>Himalayan Glow 1002 Pink Crystal Salt Lamp</a>&nbsp;marked down 50% off on Amazon!
