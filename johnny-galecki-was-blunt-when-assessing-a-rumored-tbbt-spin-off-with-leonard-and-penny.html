It was an emotional moment for the cast, and that was especially true for Johnny Galecki who was a central character on the show from day one. Galecki spoke alongside ET during the series finale party.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Galecki answered several questions, and one of them included the possibility of a spin-off featuring Penny and Leonard. Although this sounded very interesting to fans, Galecki himself just didn't see things that way.</p><p>He tells ET's Nischelle Turner, "I don't think so. I think these friends, they share seven different areas of one brain. I don't think any way you would split them up would work."</p><p>Galecki continues, "Maybe it might work for a little while. Maybe it might work well. But, we need to let what was built here kind of breathe before that's even considered."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-04t161059-934.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Men On Big Bang Theory Were Told To Grow Beards For A Certain Scene, But One Cast Member Refused And Got Fake Facial Hair Instead</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki, Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar were all supposed to grow beards, but the plan turned into a complete nightmare on TBBT.</span><p>The short interview is definitely worth the watch as Galecki also discusses how he was going into plumming just prior to getting an audition for TBBT.

However,<a href=#> there was one reason Johnny Galecki didn't leave</a>, and it was all because of the creative direction. Johnny felt as though the writing team still had stories to tell. Therefore, he made the decision to continue on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/johnny-galecki-was-blunt-when-assessing-a-rumored-tbbt-spin-off-with-leonard-and-penny-front-deposit-back-the-big-bang-theory-youtube.jpg><p>"We're very much talking about [the show's future] right now, and it seems that the writers are very confident and excited that they can write some more after this year, which is an incredible testament to them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"If they're confident that they can do more, then I know that we're still having a great time with it on stage, so hopefully a bit longer," he said.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-16t140231-538.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The One Big Bang Theory Episode That Faced A Lawsuit And Was Requested To Be Removed By Netflix Because Of Jim Parsons And Kunal Nayyar</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The Big Bang Theory ran into trouble during a controversial moment between Sheldon and Raj in season 2.</span><p>The show almost saw another major change during season 8, as <a href=#>Lorre was almost forced to write Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar off the show</a> after contract negotiations were stalling.

However, the actor wasn't prepared for the way it all came about. Johnny felt blindsided by Parsons' decision at the time, given that he wasn't approached prior.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-22t113351-464.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It could have been handled better. We're a family; have a conversation," Galecki revealed.</p><p>"And I don't even disagree with how Jim felt, because in many ways, I felt the same way. I just disagreed with how it was managed." "I was shocked. We were just blindsided that day. And not necessarily shocked by Jim's decision, but that he hadn't had that conversation with his castmates first to prepare us."</p><p>Galecki was also asked about potentially shooting season 13 without Sheldon. However, the actor admitted things wouldn't be the same without just one of the main characters.</p><p>"I don't think I could have performed in the way I wanted to, or would want to, if we did continue. I was done myself, I think. I didn't really know how to serve the character or the great writing anymore," he explained. "But none of us — the actors, writers — were comfortable with doing the show without one of us. And we absolutely would not continue on without Jim."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans are still hoping for a reboot of sorts to take place down the road.
