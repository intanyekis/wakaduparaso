And there was a man standing there with a script in his hand and he said he was a director of movies," Caine said in an interview with Variety Magazine last year.</p><p>That would become the beginning of a very fruitful partnership <a href=#>and friendship</a> between the two men, one that Caine came to thoroughly enjoy.</p><p>"Playing the movie was absolutely fantastic," he reminisced, before going to explain what he thought made Nolan special: "The thing about Nolan is you don’t always know what’s going on in the scene, as an actor. And you ask him, and he says, 'I’ll tell you after you’ve done it.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Christopher Nolan's 10 Best Movies, Ranked According To IMDb</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Caine would go on to reprise the role in The Dark Knight (2008), and eventually in The Dark Knight Rises (2012).

"He did me the first time I saw him, because we did a rehearsal on the first day, and we hadn’t met or anything. He had to come up in an elevator to our home, Batman’s home. I’m thinking I’m letting friends in, instead of which he’s killed them all, and he’s coming up in the lift.</p><p>"So on the first rehearsal, when the bloody door opened on that lift, he came tearing out," Caine continued. "I forgot every line. Terrifying."</p><p>At that moment, he knew what the rest of the world would soon come to realize as well: Ledger had created one of the best characters of modern day film.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>What The Cast Of 'The Dark Knight' Has Said About Working With Heath Ledger</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmoJWWwal5y56boJ2iYq6vsIymoJygkZq5bq%2FAoqWeZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-between-heath-ledger-and-michael-caine.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-between-heath-ledger-and-michael-caine.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-heath-ledger-and-michael-caine.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-between-heath-ledger-and-michael-caine.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-heath-ledger-and-michael-caine.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-heath-ledger-and-michael-caine.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./billionaire-daughter-dj-cuppy-prays-to-god-for-a-husband.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./billionaire-daughter-dj-cuppy-prays-to-god-for-a-husband.html>Billionaire daughter, DJ Cuppy prays to God for a husband</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./valente-rodriguez-net-worth.html>Valente Rodriguez Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./valente-rodriguez-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
