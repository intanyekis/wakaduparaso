Furnished with every conceivable and enviable amenity, the Kingdom Suite is the perfect fit for Ronaldo and his family – and the first of many impressive houses, villas, and high-end condominiums.</p><h2 id=turin-rsquo-s-tranquil-villa><strong>Turin’s Tranquil Villa</strong></h2><p>The football superstar has contributed to the bucolic landscape of Turin, Italy with his cozy (but not small) villa. Surrounded by lush green gardens and breathtaking mountain views, this Italian villa offers a comfortable and luxurious lifestyle fit for the king of the field and his family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With an approximate value of $6.5 million, his artistic manor home is equipped with the finest quality furniture, a modern private gym, an on site spa, and a swimming pool. This Italian mansion is a great example of quiet luxury, one of many among his homes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Most Expensive Celebrity Homes In Italy, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=an-iconic-madrid-mansion><strong>An Iconic Madrid Mansion</strong></h2><p>When talking about CR7’s luxury villas, who could forget Ronaldo's iconic Madrid villa? Nestled in the old world streets of the Spanish capital, this stunning property is worth $6.2 million.</p><p>This astonishing home features luxury decor, advanced amenities, and an extravagant vibe perfectly suited for the football wizard's family of seven.</p><h2 id=madeira-rsquo-s-homecoming><strong>Madeira’s Homecoming</strong></h2><p>Cristiano Ronaldo owns one of the finest mansions (with an estimated value of nearly $10 million) in his hometown of Madeira, Portugal – and it's ultra-luxe, even by celebrity standards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Boasting gigantic swimming pools, another private gym, a personal football field to practice at home, and undoubtedly impressive external architecture, this luxury estate is more proof of CR7’s long and lucrative career.</p><p>Surrounded by the lush landscape of Madeira, the opulent mansion is the perfect spot for a Ronaldo family reunion.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Rich Little Universe Of Rocky Mountains: A Look At Cristiano Ronaldo's Private Island Near Madeira Coast</a></span></p><h2 id=a-new-york-city-condo><strong>A New York City Condo</strong></h2><p>Last but not least (for homes, anyway), Ronaldo paid a staggering $18.5 million for his 2,509-square-foot <a href=#>condo in Manhattan</a>. In addition to a stunning exterior and enviable location in the heart of the city, the Manhattan condo offers a custom artistic flair introduced by globally famous designer Juan Pablo Molyneux.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Previously owned by former President Donald Trump’s business partner, Ronaldo's condo appeared to be a wise investment and complement to his portfolio of property. While Ronaldo sold the condo at a loss in late 2022, he still <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">walked away with over $7 million</a> from the sale of the Trump Tower property.</p><h2 id=wheels-that-turn-heads><strong>Wheels That Turn Heads</strong></h2><p>When we talk about Cristiano Ronaldo and his riches, it's impossible not to mention his notable collection of cars. His menagerie of luxury cars is vast and impressive, especially the crown jewels of his collection: a Bugatti La Voiture Noire, a Rolls-Royce Phantom, and a Lamborghini Aventador. His extravagant car collection reflects his impeccable taste, and they remain a point of interest for his hundreds of millions of fans worldwide.</p><h2 id=bugatti-la-voiture-noire><strong>Bugatti La Voiture Noire</strong></h2><p>Bugattis are considered among the most luxurious and expensive cars in the world, and Ronaldo owns four of them – including a Bugatti La Voiture Noire worth 8.5 million Euros.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, CR7’s collection of Bugattis includes a Bugatti Chiron, a Bugatti Centodieci, and a Bugatti Veyron, with an approximate total cost of $13.2 million. Millions of fans from all over the globe follow the footballer and his Bugattis via his Instagram account.</p><h2 id=a-rolls-royce-phantom-and-a-rolls-royce-cullinan><strong>A Rolls-Royce Phantom And A Rolls-Royce Cullinan</strong></h2><p>When people think of luxury vehicles, <a href=#>Rolls-Royce is usually at the top of the list</a>, long favored by the wealthy. And when it comes to Ronaldo, he owns two of them: the Rolls-Royce Phantom and Rolls-Royce Cullinan, with a total cost of approximately $1.3 million.</p><p>At least one of his Rolls-Royce vehicles was a gift from his partner, ringing up at around $370,000.</p><h2 id=bentleys-plural><strong>Bentleys (Plural)</strong></h2><p>With a total cost of around $532,000, the Al Nassr star has acquired two of the most appealing Bentleys, including the Bentley Continental GT and Bentley Flying Spur.</p><p>As we've observed before, <a href=#>Bentleys are the epitome of quiet luxury</a>. Even in pairs.</p><h2 id=a-lamborghini-aventador><strong>A Lamborghini Aventador</strong></h2><p>The Lamborghini Aventador is famed for its unique and extravagant appearance, and Ronaldo has furnished his garage with this $318,000 beast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ronaldo has been spotted many times with his girlfriend, driving his coveted Lamborghini Aventador on the roads and enjoying the breeze. In contrast with his Bentleys, the Lamborghini Aventador could be considered an example of "loud luxury" – but it nevertheless is an impressive vehicle that always turns heads.</p><h2 id=mclaren-senna><strong>McLaren Senna</strong></h2><p>Named after the famed Brazilian Formula One driver Ayrton Senna (in an exclusive partnership with the McLaren brand) a McLaren Senna costs a whopping $1 million apiece – a price tag that's perhaps less prohibitive for football legends. The model was specifically designed to "achieve faster lap times" in races, matching Ronaldo's speed on the pitch.</p><p>The five-time Ballon d’Or winner's taste in luxury vehicles is diverse, and the McLaren Senna is just one of the impressive fleet in his garage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=furious-ferraris><strong>Furious Ferraris</strong></h2><p>To complete this luxurious lineup, let’s talk about Ferraris. Master of the field and slayer of hearts, Cristiano Ronaldo has three fantastic Ferraris. They include the Ferrari F430, the Ferrari 599 GTB, and the Ferrari 599 GTO, with an approximate total cost of about $995,000.</p><p>Here’s where it gets interesting: Ronaldo could have owned one more Ferrari, but legend has it that the Maestro once lost a bidding battle to his field rival <a href=#>Lionel Messi</a> in a heated rush to purchase a Ferrari 355 S Spider Scaglietti.</p><h2 id=living-the-ultimate-dream><strong>Living The Ultimate Dream</strong></h2><p>The collection of Cristiano Ronaldo’s cozy villas and luxurious cars goes to show that if you’re dedicated to your craft, just make up your mind and start moving forward. Eventually, you’ll find your destiny – and if you're really lucky, a couple of Italian villas and sportscars. This once unknown football fan has journeyed a long way to reach where he is now, and Ronaldo seems to be living his ultimate dream life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnKqZqMGqrc2oZKunnpa5pbvSZqSippRir6271qKloGWdlru0tc6nqmaZnpl6tMHPnqmcmaKofA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcristiano-ronaldos-mind-blowing-mansions-and-supercars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcristiano-ronaldos-mind-blowing-mansions-and-supercars.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcristiano-ronaldos-mind-blowing-mansions-and-supercars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcristiano-ronaldos-mind-blowing-mansions-and-supercars.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcristiano-ronaldos-mind-blowing-mansions-and-supercars.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcristiano-ronaldos-mind-blowing-mansions-and-supercars.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./danica-mckellar-reveals-she-quit-acting-to-find-her-value.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./danica-mckellar-reveals-she-quit-acting-to-find-her-value.html>Danica McKellar Reveals She Quit Acting to Find Her Value</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./did-khalyla-kuhn-use-bobby-lee-for-money-net-worth.html>The Odd Reason Why Fans Think Khalyla Kuhn Used Bobby Lee For Fame</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./did-khalyla-kuhn-use-bobby-lee-for-money-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
