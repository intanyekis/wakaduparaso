"I went to go meet him one day, and his office was dark and he wasn't there and he was a workaholic, so it was completely unusual for that to be the case. And I just had this sinking feeling that something terrible had happened," she said. "And it had never crossed my mind in the past. He was very narcissistic and not someone you would ever think would take their life. But ultimately, I had found him hanging in the house that he had moved into."</p><p>Taylor continued on for season three but ultimately left before season four.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Lead To RHOA’s Cynthia Bailey’s Divorce From Mike Hill?</a></span></p><h2 id=taylor-armstrong-39-s-new-life-and-new-love><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Taylor Armstrong's New Life And New Love</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Russell's death, Taylor Armstrong was faced with some legal troubles.
