James Kennedy comes in with a net worth of $4 million, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with a wedding to plan</a>, it's clear that he'll be needing a nice chunk of that for his nuptials to Raquel Leviss. Tom Sandoval and Tom Schwartz will also be dipping into their $4 million net worth as they ready <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the opening of their new restaurant.</a> As for Lala Kent, she sits comfortably on her $2 million net worth, however, she may be coming in to more coins shortly after she and her fiancé, Randall Emmett have officially called it quits only months after the birth of their baby daughter, Ocean.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lisa-vanderpump-net-worth-90-million><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Lisa Vanderpump Net Worth: $90 Million</span></h2><p>Lisa Vanderpump is no stranger to reality television!
