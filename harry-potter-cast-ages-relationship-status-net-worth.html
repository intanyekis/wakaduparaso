Almost all the young stars made an appearance in the reunion special, and it is clear that, while they have all moved on with their lives, none of them will ever forget the experience of starring in this iconic franchise. Many of the stars have exciting new projects coming out soon, including Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, but they were clearly thrilled to take some time out of their busy schedules to appear in the reunion special.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Radcliffe will appear in the upcoming blockbuster The Lost City alongside Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock.

K. Rowling. The world of Harry Potter is so magical and mystical and Daniel Radcliffe is the face everyone recognizes when we think of it! In real life, he is 32 years old, dating a woman named Erin Darke, and living life with a net worth of $110 million. It is actually pretty shocking that he is not worth more after all of his years playing Harry Potter, but then again, he's mostly worked on <a href=#>small-budget indie films</a> since his days as Harry Potter ended.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-watson-mdash-age-31-dating-leo-robinton-net-worth-85-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Emma Watson — Age 31, Dating Leo Robinton, Net Worth $85 Million</span></h2><p>The lovely and talented Emma Watson is 31 years old and dating a man named Leo Robinton.

He was such an adorable, dorky, shy little kid when the movies started, but by the end, it was obvious that he had gained more confidence! Rupert Grint is 33 years old and dating a woman named Georgia Groome. He has a nice net worth of $50 million as it stands today. His time in the Harry Potter movie franchise will be a defining factor in his life.</p><h2 id=tom-felton-mdash-age-34-single-net-worth-20-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Tom Felton — Age 34, Single, Net Worth $20 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom Felton is a single man at 34 years old. He played the role of one of the worst bullies of all time in the Harry Potter movie franchise, Draco Malfoy. He was so mean to Harry Potter throughout the movies that it was hard to ever be on his side! The Harry Potter movies have been <a href=#>occasionally considered inappropriate</a> and Draco's constant bullying could be a huge reason why.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>5 Actors Who Hated Their Time On Harry Potter (And 10 Who Loved It)</a></span></p><p>In real life, Tom Felton is nothing like the character he played in the movies.

She played the role of Ron Weasley’s little sister and eventually, Harry Potter’s wife.

He is best known for playing Neville Longbottom in the Harry Potter movie franchise. He started off, (just like the character of Ron Weasley) super dorky and uncomfortable in his own skin.

Luna Lovegood was definitely a weirdo, but she always had good intentions, so it was easy to like her as a character. Her bright blonde hair and ghostly white skin made her a super recognizable character as well. Evanna Lynch is 30 years old, dating a man named Robbie Jarvis, and living life with a net worth of $4 million.</p><h2 id=maggie-smith-mdash-age-87-widowed-net-worth-20-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Maggie Smith — Age 87, Widowed, Net Worth $20 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As crazy as it sounds, Maggie Smith is actually 87 years old! Sadly, she has been a widow since 1998. She is one of the most memorable and recognized professors to come from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She was actually a teacher who had good intentions and wanted to take care of her students. She has a net worth of $20 million these days which is totally awesome!</p><h2 id=emma-thompson-mdash-age-62-married-to-greg-wise-net-worth-40-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Emma Thompson — Age 62, Married To Greg Wise, Net Worth $40 Million</span></h2><p>Emma Thompson is 62 years old, married to a man named Greg Wise, and living her life with a net worth of $40 million.

She is such a great actress because of how eccentric she is! She used to be married to Tim Burton from 2001 to 2014, but that marriage did not last. Helena’s list of movies is so impressive, and she tends to always play creepier characters!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>What The Cast Of Harry Potter Has Been Up To Since Deathly Hallows</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqqirnqxu9OtnKtlk5bAtXnAoJysZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq0wMCtrKxlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fharry-potter-cast-ages-relationship-status-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fharry-potter-cast-ages-relationship-status-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fharry-potter-cast-ages-relationship-status-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fharry-potter-cast-ages-relationship-status-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fharry-potter-cast-ages-relationship-status-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fharry-potter-cast-ages-relationship-status-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./owen-wilson-sons-robert-finn-relationship-with-daughter-lyla-refuses-to-see.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./owen-wilson-sons-robert-finn-relationship-with-daughter-lyla-refuses-to-see.html>Owen Wilson's Relationship With His Sons Is Completely Different From The One With His Daughter He R</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ashley-hofling-obituary-and-cause-of-death-family-mourns-loss.html>Family mourns loss The Talks Today</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ashley-hofling-obituary-and-cause-of-death-family-mourns-loss.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
