She was the second eldest of five daughters-Carolyn Moton, Jocelyn Moton, LaVern Moton-Ophelia, and Cynthia Moton. On May 3, 2023, our beloved Sandra, was called home to be with her Lord and Savior. Throughout her 64 years of life on Earth, she was known for being self-sufficient, strong-minded, and caring to all. A matriarch to her family, Sandra leaves behind a great legacy.</p><p class=p1>Sandra attended Booker T. Washington High School, in Norfolk, VA, where she was an active cheerleader. She then pursued a college career at Norfolk State University, where she took on general education and nursing classes. She would later decide to impact the lives of children and became a teacher’s assistant. For 24 years, she served the City of Norfolk Public Schools, nurturing and advocating for her students. Her colleagues and students loved her deeply. Sandra prided herself on being a light for those in dark places. The love she showed her students, she embedded in her children, along with her nieces and nephews. Sandra took time off after her time in Norfolk Public Schools to focus on caring for and spending time with the children of the Moton family. After some much-needed time with family, Sandra returned to work as a home health aide. She ended her career working for the Department of Health and Human Resources for Virginia Beach Public Schools.</p><p class=p1>Sandra attended Gethsemane Community Fellowship, where she later rededicated her life back to Christ and was baptized. Throughout her life, she enjoyed listening to great music, with some of her favorites being Sade and Luther Vandross. You could find her at all the family functions, supporting her family by celebrating all occasions. She liked collecting things and holding onto memories, whether it was a program from an awards ceremony or dated family pictures. Sandra enjoyed many things, but cooking was not one of them. She, however, had a big appetite and was always down to eat. Doing hair was not her thing, but could out dress everyone in a room, pumping in her heels. Those who knew Sandra knew she marched to the beat of her own drum. She was often told an earlier arrival time at events so that she would be on time; that half worked. Sandra was sometimes still late, but no matter how late, she always showed up! You could always find her half-asleep sitting up because she got up so early in the morning. One of her most memorable lines from Baby Alex that stuck with her was “You ain’t gon’ worry Sandra.”</p><p class=p1>Sandra was a force to be reckoned with. She was a loving and caring woman who was the glue that helped hold the Moton Family together. Sandra loved, protected, and took pride in being there for her children and her family. Her nurturing spirit was available to everyone she cared for and about. Sandra is preceded in death by her parents, Lena and Frederick Moton. Those she leaves to cherish her memories are her son; Brandon Moton; daughter; Navia Walden; husband; Sydney Lawson; sisters- Carolyn Evans, Jocelyn Moton, LaVern Moton-Ophelia, and Cynthia Moton; along with a host of nieces and nephews; extended relatives and friends. Sandra will be forever celebrated and deeply missed by her family. The life she lived and the love she gave will always live on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillam%2FsLzOpaCtmZ6bwq%2Bx0ZqjrJ2iq7aksY2cpqZnnZq6sL7ImqNoq5GjsbOtjKaYnmWdpMGwuo4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsandra-mae-moton.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsandra-mae-moton.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsandra-mae-moton.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsandra-mae-moton.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsandra-mae-moton.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsandra-mae-moton.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tammy-bradshaw-entrepreneur-wiki-biography-age-height-weight-husband-children-net-worth-facts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tammy-bradshaw-entrepreneur-wiki-biography-age-height-weight-husband-children-net-worth-facts.html>Tammy Bradshaw (Entrepreneur) Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Children, Net Worth, Fa</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./roshan-prince.html>Roshan Prince Height, Weight, Age, Body Statistics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./roshan-prince.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
