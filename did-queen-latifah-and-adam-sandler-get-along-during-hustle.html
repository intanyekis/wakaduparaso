He even vented about this in 2017, insisting that he didn’t care too much about what critics thought of his work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I know what they're going to say to every movie – they're going to say they don't like it,” the actor said. “[But] we'll be OK. I believe in my stuff. That's important to me and my friends and the people I make the movies for. I like them, that's the good news.”</p><p>That tide has started to turn in recent years, however, with the 55-year-old being lauded for productions like Murder Mystery, Uncut Gems, and Hubie Halloween. His latest release was the sports comedy-drama Hustle on Netflix, which has also been <a href=#>very well received by fans and critics alike</a>.</p><p>Hustle has done so well that Sandler is now being <a href=#>backed to win his first ever Oscar Award</a> for his work in the film.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Adam Sandler's Biggest Box Office Hit Caught Fans By Surprise</a></span></p><p>Sandler was the main star in the movie, alongside experienced actress Queen Latifah. With the two being big hitters in the industry, how did they get on behind the scenes?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-roles-do-adam-sandler-and-queen-latifah-play-in-lsquo-hustle-rsquo>What Roles Do Adam Sandler And Queen Latifah Play In ‘Hustle’?</h2><p>An online synopsis of the movie Hustle reads: ‘After a down-on-his-luck basketball scout discovers an extraordinary player abroad, he brings the phenom back without his team's approval.’ The struggling scout goes by the name Stanley Sugerman, which is the role played quite impressively by Adam Sandler. Queen Latifah features as Stanley’s wife, Teresa.</p><p>They are joined in the cast by Ben Foster, Robert Duvall and real-life Spanish basketball star Juancho Hernangómez, who currently plays for the Toronto Rapids in the NBA. It was the first acting gig for the 23-year-old athlete, whose own <a href=#>personal journey significantly mirrors that of his character</a>, Bo Cruz.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“A lot of what [Bo] has been through, I’ve been through,” Hernangómez said in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recent interview with Complex</a>. “Going to another country by yourself, trying to not give up on yourself, not give up on the people who trust you, pursue the dreams, chase the dreams no matter what, and just prove them wrong.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which Is Adam Sandler's Highest Grossing Comedy?</a></span></p><p>Veteran actor Robert Duvall (The Godfather, The Judge) plays team owner Rex Merrick of the 76ers, with Ben Foster featuring as his stubborn son, Vince.</p><h2 id=how-did-queen-latifah-and-adam-sandler-get-on-with-each-other-on-the-set-of-lsquo-hustle-rsquo>How Did Queen Latifah And Adam Sandler Get On With Each Other On The Set Of ‘Hustle’?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hustle was Queen Latifah’s second movie of 2022. The Newark-born actress also starred in a drama film titled The Tiger Rising. Written and directed by Ray Giarratana, the movie was released in January, amidst a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">controversy about actors not being paid</a>. The Tiger Rising also flopped to a $9 million loss at the box office.</p><p>The 52-year-old – <a href=#>whose birth name is Dana Elaine Owens</a> – had much better luck with the Netflix picture, which arrived on the streaming platform in June. Not only was the production a lot smoother than the Giarratana one, but she also got to work with her long-time friend, Adam Sandler.</p><p>Although Latifah’s role in Hustle was very much supportive of her on-screen partner, she enjoyed being the Robin to Sandler’s Batman.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Did Queen Latifah Amass Her $70 Million Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>“I got to play his wife, his support system, and I like him being able to show different sides of who he is and get to flex different muscles as well,” she told reporters earlier this year, adding that she had ‘a great time’ working alongside Sandler.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-adam-sandler-said-about-working-with-queen-latifah-in-lsquo-hustle-rsquo>What Has Adam Sandler Said About Working With Queen Latifah In ‘Hustle’?</h2><p>On his part, Adam Sandler also reveled in the opportunity to work with someone who he has been close with for many years. “Me and the Queen, we’ve been tight for a long time,” he said during a press event for Hustle, as was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by Yahoo! News</a>.</p><p>“I love [Queen Latifah], It was an absolute joy [working with her],” Sandler continued. “Whenever the Queen would show up on the set, anytime, any place we were, people, look [and say], ‘That's the Queen, man.’ It’s good energy. She makes people happy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the same event, Latifah commended her co-star for his dedication to the craft throughout his storied career. “He's amazing,” she gushed. “And you know, to watch him all these years do his thing and just give us so much joy and entertainment… is also just amazing.”</p><p>The actress also praised Juancho Hernangómez and the other basketball stars who were acting for the first time. “They are used to being on camera. I think it’s just kind of transferring the mindset from handling the basketball to being on camera and pretending to do what they normally do,” Latifah said.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Adam Sandler Had Specific Thoughts About Working With NBA Players For His New Film Hustle</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdpsKmsc1mo5qsmZuuqXnAp5tmmZSWum6%2FwKebpZ2iYrSmwIyao6iml2Kxtr7Ip55moKWowa2xjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-queen-latifah-and-adam-sandler-get-along-during-hustle.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-queen-latifah-and-adam-sandler-get-along-during-hustle.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-queen-latifah-and-adam-sandler-get-along-during-hustle.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-queen-latifah-and-adam-sandler-get-along-during-hustle.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-queen-latifah-and-adam-sandler-get-along-during-hustle.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-queen-latifah-and-adam-sandler-get-along-during-hustle.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-yamiche-alcindor-related-to-kareem-abdul-jabbar-relation-between-journalist-basketball-legend-explained-361161-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-yamiche-alcindor-related-to-kareem-abdul-jabbar-relation-between-journalist-basketball-legend-explained-361161-html.html>Is Yamiche Alcindor Related To Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?
